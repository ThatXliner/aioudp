Quickstart
==========

Installation
------------

Install this library via pip:

.. code-block::

    $ pip install aioudp

Example Usage
-------------

Here's a simple `PA system <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_address_system>`_ with `PyAudio <https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/>`_:

.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio
    import signal

    import pyaudio

    import aioudp

    # Doesn't have to be "\x00" and "\x01". Any unique value would do
    ACCEPT = b"\x00"
    DECLINE = b"\x01"
    TERMINATOR = b"DONE"  # Could be anything that will never be audio data
    connections = set()


    async def main():
        # Configuration for PyAudio
        CHUNK = 1024
        FORMAT = pyaudio.paInt16
        CHANNELS = 1
        RATE = 44100

        async def handler(connection):
            # Make sure only one person uses the PA at a time
            if connections:
                await connection.send(DECLINE)
                return
            await connection.send(ACCEPT)
            connections.add(None)

            # PyAudio initialization black magic
            p = pyaudio.PyAudio()
            stream = p.open(

                rate=RATE,
            )

            async for data in connection:

                if data == TERMINATOR:

                stream.write(data)

            stream.close()
            p.terminate()

            connections.remove(None)

        # This way, we can CTRl-C it properly
        loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
        stop = loop.create_future()
        loop.add_signal_handler(signal.SIGINT, stop.set_result, None)

        # "0.0.0.0" to expose globally. Serve at port 9999
        async with aioudp.serve("0.0.0.0", 9999, handler):
